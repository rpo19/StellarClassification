# Stellar Classification
This is a project for the master course of Machine Learning from Universit√† di Milano Bicocca.

It is based on this kaggle dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/deepu1109/star-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/deepu1109/star-dataset) whose title is "Star dataset to predict star types".

The project aims to analyze the dataset and then various machine learning approaches to realize a **stellar classifier**.
